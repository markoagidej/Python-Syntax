Python Indentation Practice with if Statements

Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to understand the importance of indentation in Python, especially with if statements.

Task 1: Code Correction
Below is a piece of Python code with incorrect indentation. Your task is to correct it.

weather = "sunny"

if weather == "sunny":
print("Wear sunglasses!")
else:
print("Take an umbrella!")
Task 2: Your Mood Today
Ask the user how they feel today. If they say "happy", print "That's great to hear!", and if they say "sad", print "I hope your day gets better!". Ensure your if statement is properly indented.

By the end of this assignment, you should feel more confident about how if statements work in Python and how to indent them properly.

2. Python Naming Convention Practice
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to understand and apply Python's naming conventions, particularly for variables and constants.

Task 1: Code Correction
You have been given a piece of code with several variable and constant names that don't follow the Python naming convention. Your task is to correct them:

Pi_value = 3.14
userAge = 25
user_location = "New York"
MAXLIMIT = 1000
3. Python Data Types and type() Function
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to practice identifying and using Python's basic data types, as well as the type() function for checking a variable's data type.

Task 1: Code Correction
Given below are some variable assignments. Your task is to identify the data type of each variable and then use the type() function to print it out:

variable_a = "Hello, World!"
variable_b = 23
variable_c = 3.14
variable_d = True
4. Arithmetic Operations in Daily Life
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with basic arithmetic operations and understand how they can be applied in everyday situations.

Task 1: Grocery Store Math
Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic

Task 2: Bank Interest
If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.

5. Understanding Assignments and Comparisons
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to get a grasp on how assignment operators work and how values can be compared using comparison operators.

Task 1: Value Swapping
Swap the values of two given numbers using assignment operators (=) and then compare them to ensure they have been swapped.

6. Exploring Logical Operations and Precedence
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to grasp the concept of logical operations and understand how operator precedence can affect the outcome of an operation.

Task 1: Validating Calculations
Calculate the value of a particular arithmetic expression twice: once normally, and once using parentheses. Compare the two results to see if they match.

Task 2: Mix and Match
Combine arithmetic (+), logical (or), and comparison (>) operators in a single expression and predict the outcome. Then, compute the expression to see if the prediction was correct.
